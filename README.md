# Amit-project-
multi-class skin problem classification using deep learning and machine learning algorithms

Each folder is labeled with a specific order to understand the steps of the project starting from (1) until reaching (4).

Part 1: Monkeypox Skin Image Dataset(1) this folder contains the data image loaded from
Kaggle.

Part 2: google colab, this folder contains a description of the data used, some changes a
Some_data_preparation,_preprocessing_and_visualization.

Part 3: Data augmentation on the fly& hyper tune vgg16(3)

Part 4: pre-trained models & ML classification algorithm(4), and the notebook Vgg16
weights with Random Forest classifier (main notebook), contain the main idea, problem,
and solution.
